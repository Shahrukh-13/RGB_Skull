# RGB_Skull
Papercraft skull with WS2812 RGB LEDs

# Papercraft
This papercraft skull is a part of free papercraft designed by Methakura. This is the link of the designer's website: https://methakura.gumroad.com/

and this is the link of the papercraft where I took the skull from: https://methakura.gumroad.com/l/octoskull?layout=profile

I have added the PDF file of the paercraft in the /Papercraft/ folder. There are two versions of skull in this papercraft, if you want to make the one I made then use Page 1-8. The papercraft does not have the cutouts on the sides and the top of the skull, you will have to cut them out yourself. 

# Arduino code
I am using arduino nano to control WS2812 LEDs. You will need FastLED library, you can either use the FastLED libray files that I have added in the /Arduino/Library or you can download the latest one from the Github:
https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

I am using this color palette for the WS2812 LEDs: http://seaviewsensing.com/pub/cpt-city/bhw/bhw3/tn/bhw3_51.png.index.html

You will need PaletteKnife tool to get the color gradient for Arduino code: https://fastled.io/tools/paletteknife/

I have added the schematic in the folder for Arduino and LEDs connections.
